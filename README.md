# Dactyl ManuForm Keyboard

This is a fork of the [Dactyl-ManuForm](https://github.com/tshort/dactyl-keyboard). The Dactyl-Manuform is a fork of the [Dactyl](https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard) with the thumb cluster from [ManuForm](https://github.com/jeffgran/ManuForm). Some features from the Dactyl Manuform Mini are kept along with new features added. 

## Features

- The use of sidenubs can be disabled. Sidenub should be disabled if you use Kailh, and Outemu. If you use Cherry MX, Gateron or Zealios switches, you can enable the sidenubs.

- Toggle for outer column between using 1.5u sized keys and 1u sized keys. If enabled, the rows which use 1.5u sized keys can be specified.

- Toggle between using the manuform thumb cluster, the mini thumb cluster designed by [l4u](https://github.com/l4u/dactyl-manuform-mini-keyboard), and the cf thumb cluster.
- The cf thumb cluster uses the same keycaps as the manuform, but is more compact. The thumb only has to move one position left or right from its neutral position to reach all the keys.

- Removable MCU holder. This holder slides into a cutout on the back wall of the case. Designed for RP2040 based MCU shown [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/comments/1304ucc/new_mcu_for_dactyls_using_an_rp2040/).

## Generate OpenSCAD and STL models

* Run `lein generate` or `lein auto generate`
* This will regenerate the `things/*.scad` files
* Use OpenSCAD to open a `.scad` file.
* Make changes to design, repeat `load-file`, OpenSCAD will watch for changes and rerender.
* When done, use OpenSCAD to export STL files
